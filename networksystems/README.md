# Overview

**MIAR** is a research-grade supply chain risk intelligence platform built by Johns Hopkins University researchers. We help energy companies, manufacturers, and defense contractors identify and mitigate risks in their critical mineral supply chains.

## The Problem We Solve

Energy companies building battery storage projects need 50,000+ tons of lithium, cobalt, and other critical minerals. But:
- **68% flows through African supply chains** with political instability risks
- **60% of processing** happens in China, creating geopolitical dependency
- **Price volatility**: 300%+ spikes in 2021-2022
- **Single-source risks**: 70% of cobalt comes from DRC alone

**One supply disruption can delay projects 6-12 months and cost $50M-$200M+**

## Our Solution

## Use Cases & Examples

### **Case Study: Constellation Energy 5GW Battery Storage**

**Challenge:**
Constellation planned 5GW of battery storage requiring 50,000 tons of critical minerals. They faced:
- 70% cobalt dependency on DRC (high political risk)
- 60% lithium processing in China (geopolitical risk)
- Potential $180M financial exposure from disruptions

**Our Solution:**
- Identified 2 critical supply chain bottlenecks
- Modeled 4 cost impact scenarios (baseline to critical failure)
- Recommended 4 strategic actions with ROI projections
- **Result**: Diversification strategy reducing risk score from 7.2 to 4.8

**ROI**: $12M investment to mitigate $180M exposure = 15x return

## Why MIAR Wins

### **1. Research-Grade Data Quality**
Academic rigor meets commercial speed. Our data is validated, not scraped.

### **2. African Market Expertise**
We have on-the-ground intelligence competitors lack. 68% of critical minerals flow through Africa - we know these routes intimately.

### **3. Proven ROI**
One avoided disruption pays for years of service. Cost of our intelligence: $25K-$100K. Cost of a 6-month delay: $50M-$200M.

### **4. Network Effects**
Unlike generic risk platforms, we understand supply chain network dynamics - who controls chokepoints, how disruptions cascade, where alternatives exist.

### **5. Speed to Insight**
Traditional consultants take 3-6 months. We deliver actionable intelligence in 2 weeks.
