## The Moat: How TerraNexus Becomes Defensible

### Data Moat (TerraData Network™)

**Mechanism:**
1. Each new customer adds constraints data
2. Data is anonymized and aggregated
3. Network becomes more valuable with scale
4. Late entrants cannot replicate

**Network Effect Example:**
```
Customer 1 joins:   10 mines worth of constraints data
Customer 10 joins:  100 mines worth of data → 10x better benchmarks
Customer 100 joins: 1,000 mines → industry standard, impossible to replicate
```

**Defensibility:**
- 3-5 year head start = insurmountable
- Data compounds with every customer
- Switching costs increase with network participation

### Technology Moat (Nexus Core™)

**Unique Capabilities:**
- **Constraint-based optimization** (not just simulation)
- **Financial impact quantification** (NPV-linked decisions)
- **Multi-horizon planning** (tactical to strategic in one model)
- **Industry-specific physics** (mining, energy, industrials)

**Intellectual Property:**
- Proprietary algorithms (patent pending)
- 5+ years of R&D investment
- Domain expert knowledge embedded in code

### Expertise Moat (Advisory Services)

**Human Capital:**
- Former mining executives
- Supply chain PhDs
- Energy industry veterans
- Management consultants

**Embedded Knowledge:**
- Onboarding creates deep client integration
- Quarterly reviews build relationships
- Rapid response creates dependency
- Co-creation of features builds lock-in

**High Margin:**
- 70%+ gross margin on services
- Upsell opportunity
- Stickiness through relationships
