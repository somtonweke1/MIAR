## For BIS Entity List Expansion Discussion

## Version 1: Short & Direct (Recommended for Fast-Moving Chats)

```
This BIS entity list expansion is exactly why we built our supply chain risk intelligence platform at MIAR.

We automatically map supplier ownership trees and flag entity list exposure in real-time.

If anyone wants to run a free compliance check on their supply chain against the expanded rules, DM me. Takes about 48 hours to map your suppliers and identify exposure.

Free for the first 10 companies.

## Version 2: Value-First (If Group is Discussion-Oriented)

```
Saw this update about the BIS entity list expansion. The affiliate coverage is going to catch a lot of companies by surprise.

The challenge isn't just checking the list - it's mapping ownership structures to see which of your suppliers are affected. We've been tracking this at MIAR.

We built a scanner that:
- Maps supplier ownership trees automatically
- Cross-references with BIS entity list (including new affiliate rules)
- Identifies alternative compliant sources
- Delivers full report in 48 hours

Running free compliance checks for first 10 companies who want to validate their supply chain exposure.

If interested: https://networksystems.vercel.app/entity-list-scanner

Happy to discuss the technical approach if folks are curious about the methodology.

## Version 3: Thought Leadership (For Groups Where You're Establishing Expertise)

```
The BIS entity list affiliate expansion is a perfect example of why manual compliance checks don't scale.

Most companies are checking supplier names against the list. But with the new rules, you need to map:
- Parent company ownership
- Subsidiary relationships
- Joint venture stakes
- Cross-border affiliations

One listed entity can affect dozens of suppliers through ownership structures.

At MIAR, we're solving this with automated ownership tree mapping + real-time entity list monitoring. Built on network analysis algorithms we developed at Johns Hopkins.

We're offering free compliance checks (48-hour turnaround) for the first 10 companies. Want to validate this is a real problem worth solving vs. just interesting technically.

Would love feedback from the group on:
1. How are you currently monitoring entity list changes?
2. Do you have visibility into supplier ownership structures?
3. What's your process when a supplier gets listed?
```

## Version 4: Question-First (Engages Discussion Before Pitching)

```
Question for the group about this BIS entity list expansion:

How are you currently tracking which of your suppliers might be affected by the affiliate rules?

The ownership structure mapping seems like it would be impossibly manual at scale - especially for companies with 100+ suppliers.

Curious what approaches people are taking. We're experimenting with automated ownership tree mapping at MIAR, but want to understand how the industry is handling this today.

[Wait for responses]

[Follow-up after responses:]
Thanks for sharing! Yeah, the manual approach is rough. We built a tool that automates this - maps ownership structures and cross-references with entity list. Running free checks for anyone who wants to validate their supply chain. DM if interested.

## Key Principles for Any Version:

### DO:
- ✅ Lead with value (solve their problem)
- ✅ Offer something free (compliance check)
- ✅ Time-box the free offer ("first 10 companies")
- ✅ Include clear CTA (link + DM invitation)
- ✅ Show expertise (Johns Hopkins, network algorithms)
- ✅ Ask for feedback (validates you're listening)

### DON'T:
- ❌ Make it all about you ("We built this amazing thing!")
- ❌ Over-explain the technology (they don't care about tech, they care about results)
- ❌ Ignore the conversation thread (respond to what was just said)
- ❌ Be salesy ("Limited time offer! Act now!")
- ❌ Forget to follow up (DMs with interested people within 24 hours)

## Follow-Up Message Templates

### When Someone DMs You:

**Template 1: Quick Responder**
```
Hey! Thanks for reaching out about the entity list compliance check.

Quick process:
1. Share your supplier list (CSV, Excel, or PDF) - just company names is fine
2. We map ownership structures & cross-reference with BIS entity list
3. You get detailed report in 48 hours showing:
   - Which suppliers have exposure
   - Risk scores
   - Alternative compliant sources

No cost for this first check. If you find it valuable, we can discuss ongoing monitoring.

Want to send over your supplier list?
```

**Template 2: Consultative Approach**
```
Hey! Saw you're interested in the entity list compliance check.

Before I send you the upload link - quick question: What's driving this for you? Are you:
a) Responding to a specific supplier concern?
b) Doing proactive compliance review?
c) Preparing for audit?

Helps me tailor the report to what you actually need vs. generic analysis.

Also - ballpark how many suppliers are we talking? (Doesn't have to be exact)
```

**Template 3: If They're Hesitant**
```
Totally understand if you want to think about it!

No pressure - the free compliance check offer stands. Here's the link if you decide to go for it: https://networksystems.vercel.app/entity-list-scanner

Also happy to just share our approach to entity list monitoring if you're curious about the methodology, even if you don't want to share supplier data. A lot of folks find the ownership tree mapping interesting from a technical standpoint.

Let me know!
```

## Response to Common Questions:

### "How do you map ownership structures?"
```
Great question! We combine:
1. Public corporate filings (SEC, company registries)
2. Commercial databases (Dun & Bradstreet, Bloomberg)
3. Network analysis algorithms to trace relationships

For complex ownership structures (joint ventures, holding companies), we manually verify the connections. Takes longer but way more accurate than automated-only approaches.

The BIS entity list is the easy part - it's publicly available. The hard part is mapping which of YOUR suppliers are connected to listed entities through ownership.
```

### "What do you do with our supplier data?"
```
Security & privacy:
- Your supplier list is stored encrypted
- We only use it for your compliance report
- Never shared with third parties
- Deleted after 90 days unless you request ongoing monitoring

We're Johns Hopkins researchers, not a data broker. The whole point is to help you de-risk your supply chain, not to harvest supplier data.

Happy to sign an NDA if your company requires it.
```

### "Can you check just one supplier?"
```
Absolutely! For a single supplier, I can usually turn this around in 24 hours vs. 48.

Just send me:
- Supplier company name
- Country/location (helps with disambiguation)
- Any known parent companies or affiliates

I'll map the ownership structure and flag any entity list exposure.

Still free for you since you're in the first 10.
```

### "What's the catch? Why free?"
```
Fair question! Two reasons:

1. Validation: We want to prove this is a real problem worth solving. If 10 companies try it and say "meh, not useful" then we pivot. If they say "this is gold, when can I get continuous monitoring?" then we know we're onto something.

2. Lead generation: Obviously we hope some of the free checks turn into paying customers for our full platform (ongoing monitoring, real-time alerts, etc.). But zero pressure - free check is genuinely free.

Worst case for you: You get a useful compliance report at no cost.
Best case for us: You find it valuable enough to become a customer.

Win-win.
```

### "How much does the full platform cost?"
```
Depends on what you need:

One-time deep-dive: $5,000
- Comprehensive compliance report
- Alternative sourcing recommendations
- 2-week delivery

Professional (annual): $25,000/year
- Continuous entity list monitoring
- Real-time alerts when suppliers get listed
- Monthly risk briefings
- 2 deep-dive assessments per year

Enterprise (annual): $100,000/year
- Everything in Professional
- Dedicated analyst
- Unlimited assessments
- API integration
- Quarterly executive briefings

For most companies, Professional is the sweet spot. But let's start with the free check - see if the intel is even useful first.

## Example Full Conversation Flow

**You (Initial Post):**
> [Use Version 1 or 2 from above]

**Group Member:**
> "How accurate is the ownership mapping? We tried a vendor for this last year and it missed a bunch of relationships."

**You (Response):**
> "Great question! Accuracy is the whole game here. We combine automated data pulls with manual verification for complex structures - slower but way more accurate. What vendor did you use? Curious what they missed so we can make sure we're not making the same mistakes."

**Group Member:**
> "[Vendor name]. They didn't catch joint ventures or minority stakes under 25%."

**You:**
> "Ah yeah, that's a common gap. We specifically track minority stakes down to 10% because BIS's affiliate rules can apply at that level depending on the entity. Happy to run a free check on your suppliers if you want to compare accuracy to [vendor name]. No obligation."

**Group Member:**
> "Let me check with our procurement team. Might take you up on that."

**You (DM Next Day):**
> "Hey! Following up on our conversation about entity list mapping. Any update from your procurement team? Happy to do a quick check on just 1-2 of your highest-risk suppliers if you want to validate accuracy before committing to a full supplier list review."
